# Production Readiness Audit

This document records the Phase 11 audit. Statuses are honest: **Verified**
means exercised locally and/or in CI; **Partial** means implemented but not fully
exercised; **Planned** means tracked as future work.

## Security

| Item | Status | Notes |
| ---- | ------ | ----- |
| No key/secret handling | Verified | No wallet, key, or credential code. |
| No code execution of scanned input | Verified | Static parsing only. |
| No network access | Verified | No HTTP client dependency. |
| Path traversal protection | Verified | Engine rejects unsafe locations; `--files-from` rejects `..`. |
| Parser DoS protection | Verified | Delimiter-nesting guard; malformed-input tests. |
| Symlink safety | Verified | Not followed by default. |
| Untrusted config | Verified | Strict parsing; config cannot grant capabilities. |
| No secret leakage in reports | Verified | No environment reads; relativized paths. |
| Supply chain | Verified | `cargo-deny` in CI (advisories, licenses, bans, sources). |

## Reliability and error handling

| Item | Status | Notes |
| ---- | ------ | ----- |
| Graceful parse failures | Verified | Diagnostics, not panics. |
| Deterministic output | Verified | Repeated-scan byte-identity tests. |
| Stable exit codes | Verified | 0/1/2/3 documented and tested. |
| Malformed manifest handling | Verified | Nested manifests become diagnostics. |

## Performance

| Item | Status | Notes |
| ---- | ------ | ----- |
| Benchmark harness | Verified | `examples/benchmark.rs`. |
| Baseline measurements | Verified | Documented in `development/benchmarks.md`. |
| Linear scaling | Verified | Measured 100–10,000 entry points. |

## Documentation

| Item | Status | Notes |
| ---- | ------ | ----- |
| README, CLI, config, rules, baselines | Verified | Reviewed against implementation. |
| Getting started, installation, troubleshooting | Verified | Tested commands. |
| Architecture and ADRs | Verified | Matches implementation. |
| Security and threat model | Verified | Matches implementation. |
| GitHub integration | Partial | Workflows run in CI; PR workflow awaits a PR. |
| Compatibility and release docs | Verified | Added in Phase 11. |
| Contributor docs and rule template | Verified | Present. |

## Testing

| Item | Status | Notes |
| ---- | ------ | ----- |
| Unit tests | Verified | Core and CLI. |
| Integration tests | Verified | Corpus, rule quality, adversarial, project detection, CLI. |
| Security regression corpus | Verified | Positive/negative fixtures per rule. |
| Adversarial tests | Verified | Malformed/deep/large/unicode inputs. |

## CI and integrations

| Item | Status | Notes |
| ---- | ------ | ----- |
| CI (fmt, clippy, tests, deny) | Verified | Green on every push. |
| Security Scan workflow + SARIF upload | Verified | Ran successfully on GitHub. |
| PR changed-file workflow | Partial | Authored; runs on the next pull request. |
| Composite action | Partial | Authored; not yet consumed by an external repo. |

## Known limitations

- Seven detectors; several are heuristic and intentionally low-confidence.
- No type resolution or cross-function data flow.
- MSRV is not pinned or CI-tested.
- Prebuilt release binaries are not yet produced.
- No crates.io publishing.
- Only structural SARIF validation plus one successful GitHub code-scanning
  upload.

## Verdict

**MVP-ready.** The scanner is installable, usable, tested, documented,
CI-gated, and safe on untrusted input. It is not a substitute for a professional
audit, and the heuristic detectors are labeled as such.
