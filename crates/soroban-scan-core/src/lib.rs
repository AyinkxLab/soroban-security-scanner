//! Soroban Security Scanner — core analysis engine.
//!
//! Deterministic, evidence-based security analysis for Stellar Soroban smart
//! contracts and Soroban-related Rust projects.
//!
//! # Design principles
//!
//! * **Deterministic** — identical input produces identical output. No
//!   wall-clock, randomness, or environment-specific ordering is allowed to
//!   influence findings.
//! * **Evidence-based** — every finding cites concrete source evidence. Rules
//!   may not fabricate findings or source locations.
//! * **Non-executing** — the scanner never compiles, executes, deploys, signs,
//!   or mutates the code it analyzes. Scanned repositories are treated as
//!   hostile input.
//! * **AI-optional** — the deterministic engine is authoritative. Any future AI
//!   assistance is advisory only.
