# Examples

Real, compilable example projects used to demonstrate the scanner and to act as
end-to-end fixtures. Each example is a standalone crate (excluded from the
workspace) and is built in CI.

| Example | Kind | Expected findings |
| ------- | ---- | ----------------- |
| [`clean-contract`](clean-contract/) | Soroban vault (clean) | none |
| [`vulnerable-contract`](vulnerable-contract/) | Soroban vault (intentionally vulnerable) | SS-001, SS-002, SS-004, SS-006, SS-007 |
| [`token`](token/) | Soroban fungible token (clean) | none |
| [`escrow`](escrow/) | Soroban escrow (clean) | none |
| [`vault`](vault/) | Soroban pausable vault (clean) | none |
| [`stellar-classic`](stellar-classic/) | Classic Stellar address tooling | none (not a Soroban project) |

## Build an example

Examples target `soroban-sdk` 28 and are excluded from the main workspace. Build
them directly by manifest path:

```bash
cargo check --manifest-path examples/token/Cargo.toml
```

## Scan an example

```bash
# The clean examples must pass a strict gate.
soroban-scan scan examples/token --fail-on high

# The vulnerable example is expected to produce findings.
soroban-scan scan examples/vulnerable-contract --fail-on none
```

## Safety

The examples are never executed, deployed, or signed. `vulnerable-contract`
contains deliberate security flaws and must not be used as a template.

Examples must never require network access at runtime and must never contain
secrets, keys, or real account credentials.
