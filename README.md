`soroban-scan` statically analyzes Soroban/Rust source code and reports security
findings with stable rule identifiers, severity and confidence ratings, precise
source locations, evidence, and remediation guidance.

The core scanner is **deterministic** and **AI-independent**. It never executes,
deploys, signs, or mutates the code it analyzes.

> **Project status:** early development. See [`docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md`](docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md)
> for an honest, continuously updated description of what exists today.

---

## Why

Soroban smart contracts handle real value, and security review is still largely
manual and ad hoc. Generic Rust linters (`clippy`) do not understand Soroban
semantics, and general-purpose static analyzers do not model Soroban's
authorization, storage, and resource model.

`soroban-scan` fills that gap with focused, Soroban-aware detectors, a
deterministic rule engine, and CI-friendly machine-readable output (JSON, SARIF).

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AyinkxLab/soroban-security-scanner
cd soroban-security-scanner
cargo build --release

# Scan a contract and print findings
./target/release/soroban-scan scan ./examples/vulnerable-contract --fail-on none

# Machine-readable output for CI
./target/release/soroban-scan scan . --format sarif --output results.sarif
```

Requires a stable Rust toolchain. See [`docs/development/setup.md`](docs/development/setup.md).

## What it detects

Seven Soroban-aware detectors ship today (`SS-001`–`SS-007`). Severity and
confidence are independent and always reported honestly.

| Rule | Title | Severity | Confidence | Category |
| ---- | ----- | -------- | ---------- | -------- |
| [SS-001](docs/rules/detectors/SS-001.md) | State-changing entry point without caller authorization | high | medium | authorization |
| [SS-002](docs/rules/detectors/SS-002.md) | Cross-contract call without caller authorization | high | low | cross-contract |
| [SS-003](docs/rules/detectors/SS-003.md) | Unbounded storage iteration in an entry point | medium | low | resource-usage |
| [SS-004](docs/rules/detectors/SS-004.md) | Panic-prone construct in a contract entry point | low | medium | error-handling |
| [SS-005](docs/rules/detectors/SS-005.md) | Unsafe code in a Soroban contract | medium | high | unsafe |
| [SS-006](docs/rules/detectors/SS-006.md) | Persistent storage write without TTL management | low | low | storage |
| [SS-007](docs/rules/detectors/SS-007.md) | Hardcoded Stellar account or contract address | medium | low | configuration |

Rule identifiers are stable (never reused or renumbered). See
[`docs/rules/README.md`](docs/rules/README.md) for the full rule system.

## Goals

- Detect real Soroban security problems (authorization, arithmetic, storage,
  resource usage, unsafe patterns, and more).
- Produce reproducible, evidence-based findings — never fabricated ones.
- Integrate cleanly with CI and GitHub code scanning via SARIF.
- Stay useful with no network access and no AI.
- Be safe to run on untrusted repositories.

## Non-goals

- The scanner does not replace professional security audits.
- The scanner does not execute or deploy contracts.
- The scanner does not require private keys, wallets, or network access.
- AI is never the authoritative security engine.

## Implemented today

- Deterministic project discovery and Soroban classification.
- `syn`-based Rust parsing with source locations.
- Seven security detectors (`SS-001`–`SS-007`) with fixtures and documentation.
- CLI: `scan`, `rules`, `explain`, `version`, `init`, `config`.
- Output formats: terminal, JSON, SARIF 2.1.0, Markdown.
- Configurable rule selection, thresholds, and excludes.
- Baselines and incremental scanning (`--baseline`, `--write-baseline`,
  `--new-only`, `--incremental`).
- GitHub Actions security-scan workflow with SARIF upload.
- Composite GitHub Action and changed-file pull-request scanning.
- Optional, clearly labeled assistance (`--guidance`); off by default and never
  authoritative.
- A compilable example suite: clean and intentionally vulnerable Soroban
  contracts (token, escrow, vault) plus a classic Stellar address example,
  built in CI.

## Usage

```bash
# Scan a project
soroban-scan scan ./contracts

# Machine-readable output
soroban-scan scan ./contracts --format json --output report.json --fail-on none
soroban-scan scan ./contracts --format sarif --output results.sarif

# Explore rules
soroban-scan rules
soroban-scan explain SS-001

# Configuration
soroban-scan init
soroban-scan config validate
```

See [`docs/cli.md`](docs/cli.md) for the full reference, including configuration
and stable exit codes.

## Demo

Scanning the intentionally vulnerable example (real output):

```console
$ soroban-scan scan examples/vulnerable-contract --fail-on none --quiet
high SS-001 src/lib.rs:23:9
low SS-006 src/lib.rs:23:9
low SS-004 src/lib.rs:30:9
medium SS-007 src/lib.rs:40:13
high SS-002 src/lib.rs:46:22
5 finding(s) — critical: 0, high: 2, medium: 1, low: 2, info: 0
```

Explore what a finding means:

```console
$ soroban-scan explain SS-001
SS-001 — State-changing entry point without caller authorization

Severity:   high
Confidence: medium
Category:   authorization
...
```

## Continuous integration & GitHub code scanning

Emit SARIF and upload it to GitHub code scanning, or use the bundled composite
Action to scan only the files changed in a pull request. See
[`docs/github-integration.md`](docs/github-integration.md) and
[`action.yml`](action.yml).

```yaml
- uses: AyinkxLab/soroban-security-scanner@main
  with:
    fail-on: high
```

See [`docs/architecture/overview.md`](docs/architecture/overview.md) and the
[architecture decision records](docs/architecture/adr/).

## Security model

The scanner treats every scanned repository as **hostile input**. It does not
require or store keys, does not sign or submit transactions, does not execute
scanned code, and makes no network requests by default. See
[`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) and [`docs/security/threat-model.md`](docs/security/threat-model.md).

## Ecosystem

`soroban-scan` is built for the Stellar/Soroban ecosystem and is designed to sit
alongside the official toolchain:

- Stellar developer docs — <https://developers.stellar.org/>
- Soroban smart contracts guide — <https://developers.stellar.org/docs/smart-contracts>
- Stellar — <https://stellar.org/>

We aim to be listed among the community's Soroban developer tooling. If your
project would benefit from Soroban-aware static analysis in CI, open an issue and
we'll help wire it up.
